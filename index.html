    <div class="aboutSubtitle">The Latest Innovation In Operating System Technology.</div>

    Using the newest technological advancements in the realm of operating system development, the members at Hello
    World Inc. were able to harness the true power of our modern technology. Let us show you limits of humankind and
    how the engineers at Hello World Inc. surpassed what we thought was previously impossible.

    <div class="aboutSubtitle" style="color:white;">The Most Lightweight Operating System The World Has Ever Seen.</div>

    Other large-scale operating systems such as Windows, MacOS and Linux take a heavy toll on the computer's hardware.
    Not only do those operating systems take forever to boot from startup, but they also use up valuable computing power
    and resources that should be saved to use for actual useful work.
    <br><br>
    Our engineers tackled these problems by stripping
    unnecessary modules and functions from traditional operating systems. What we are left with is an efficient powerhouse,
    a machine tailored to do tasks that were previously impossible to do without resources hogged by the operating system.

    Wondering why the Hello World OS™ bar is missing? Hello World OS™ takes up 16KB (0.016MB) of your disk space, 1 million
    times more lightweight than Windows 10, the most popular operating system in the world. The bar is not missing, it's lightweight.

    <div class="aboutSubtitle">Hello World OS™ Reinvents I/O.</div>

    Modern computers have complex input and output systems. Although that may provide slight advantages to professionals
    and nerds, most daily users do not need the complexity that the modern I/O systems provide, and can actually suffer
    from the confusion, killing their productivity and enjoyment of using their computers.
    <br><br>
    This is why our designers took on the task to make Hello World OS™ the most user-friendly operating system ever.
    Here are a few I/O interfaces that our bold and innovative designers have decided to remove: multiple HDMI outputs,
    keyboard inputs, mouse/cursor inputs, USB ports, audio output, graphics cards, and so on.

    <div class="aboutSubtitle">The Concept Behind The New I/O System.</div>

    Hello World OS™ features a one-of-a-kind I/O system: no inputs from the user except for power, no audio
    output, and only one monitor. With this new system, even beginner users can feel right at home, having as much control
    over their computer as professionals have over theirs: zero. Because this is what the world of computing needs.
    <br><br>
    Why did we opt for such a non-traditional I/O system? That is because as humans, we are not perfect. We make a lot of mistakes,
    which can cause a lot of trouble. With this new system, we no longer have any control over our computer, and therefore cannot
    make any mistakes, making this the perfect operating system for any task.

    <div class="aboutSubtitle">Hello World OS™ Can Help Kick Computer Addiction.</div>

    As many people may know, computer addiction is an increasingly serious problem. People, especially children, are drawn to
    using their computers the entire day instead of leaving their house and experiencing the outside world. If this continues,
    our future generation will be doomed.
    <br><br>
    This is the reason why the designers here at Hello World Inc. decided to opt for a charming retro design for Hello World OS™.
    Hello World OS™ doesn't feature fancy graphics. In fact, Hello World OS™ doesn't feature any graphics. Hello World OS™ exists as
    a terminal interface, which is appealing to people of older age, but deters younger children. This means that children can finally
    kick their computer addiction, go out, and experience this crazy dance called life.
